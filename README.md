# Payment Plan Optimizer

The Payment Plan Optimizer is a Python-based tool designed to assist users in managing their debts more effectively. Utilizing machine learning models, the optimizer analyzes various repayment strategies, such as the Snowball and Avalanche methods, to recommend the most efficient strategy based on the user's unique financial situation.

Data
This project uses synthetic financial data to simulate various debt scenarios and repayment strategies. The data schema includes fields such as Initial_Debt, Interest_Rate, Monthly_Income, and Repayment_Strategy.

Model Development
The core of the Payment Plan Optimizer is a Decision Tree Classifier, trained on synthetic financial data to predict the most effective repayment strategy for any given financial situation. For more details on the model development process, refer to the notebooks/model_development.ipynb notebook.
