# Load the trained model
model = joblib.load('models/model_file.pkl')

# Assuming you have new data to predict on, you would load it similarly to how you loaded your training data.
# For demonstration purposes, this code will not run as-is because it depends on your new data.

# Example: Load new data (this should be replaced with your actual new data path)
# new_data = pd.read_csv('path/to/your/new_data.csv')

# The following steps are necessary if your new data needs to be preprocessed similar to your training data.

# Example preprocessing steps (adjust according to your actual preprocessing needs):
# 1. Encode categorical variables if your model requires numeric input
# label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
# new_data['Some_Categorical_Column'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(new_data['Some_Categorical_Column'])

# 2. Select features that your model was trained on
# X_new = new_data[['Feature1', 'Feature2', 'Feature3']]  # Replace with your actual features

# Make predictions with the model
# predictions = model.predict(X_new)

# Optionally, convert predictions back to original labels if you used label encoding
# predictions_labels = label_encoder.inverse_transform(predictions)

# Output or use the predictions
# print(predictions)
# For example, saving to a CSV file
# pd.DataFrame(predictions).to_csv('path/to/your/predictions.csv', index=False)

# Remember to replace placeholders and examples with your actual data loading, preprocessing, and usage steps.
